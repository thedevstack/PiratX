monocles chat is a modern and secure Android XMPP chat client. Based on blabber .im and Conversations but with a lot of changes and additional features.
to improve usability and security.

Connection security and the protection of personal data are very important for
us, so we enforce encrypted connections between chat and server, making it
almost impossible to intercept and read your messages by strangers. Therefore we  removed older cipher suits. These are adapted to the monocles chat server nevertheless they are still compatible with other xmpp server using todays standards.

If that's not enough for you, end-to-end message encryption such as OMEMO
or OpenPGP can be used. This allows messages to be encrypted on the sending
device and decrypted only by the receiving device intended for reception.

Features:
* End-to-end encryption with either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging">OTR</a>, <a href="http://conversations.im/omemo/">OMEMO</a> or <a href="http://openpgp.org/about/">OpenPGP</a>
* Send and receive images as well as other files
* Send and receive locations
